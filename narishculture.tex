\part{History of Nareland}

Nareland is an island, roughly equivalent in size to Sardinia, located 200km west of the coast of Norway and 50km north of the Orkney Islands of Scotland.

\chapter{Pre-history}

At the end of the last great iceage, the powerful wash of the glacial runoffs exiting the Scandinavian peninsula carried soil out into the North Sea, where the soil accumulated up against hilly formations north of Scotland to form a bank.

Archeological findings suggest that the island has been inhabited since the mesolithic period, having been settled upon as early as 12,000 years ago by a culture predating even the Narish people. As the ice sheet covering the north sea retracted, the prehistoric population of the British isles crept north in tow, while the rising sea levels eliminated any land bridges to Nareland behind them. The fate of these early indigenous peoples is uncertain.

The Narish people originally inhabited the western coast of the Scandinavian peninsula well before the arrival of Indo-European settlers. 

\chapter{Early history}



\chapter{Scandinavian immigrant waves}

During the 8th and 9th century, the island saw numerous visits from Norsemen, who attempted to colonize it. Their invasion of the island was largely motivated by the overpopulation of Scandinavia, as well as opponents of Harald I Hairfair and his reign over a now-united kingdom of Norway. These attempts were initially quelled by the Narish, and written accords from the Norsemen show these struggles pervaded through much of the 9th century. However, tides turned when Harald Hairfair, attracted by the vast arable plains of Nareland, amassed his navy and sailed for the island in the 870's. Although unsuccessful in seizing the entire island, he was able to establish a fortified colony on the southeastern coast named Haraldsborg. 

With a rise in population, the colony was prone to overflow. New settlers would seek lands outside of the fortifications on which to build their farmsteads, even neighboring more amiable Narish inhabitants in certain cases. While initial relations were hostile, over time the Scandinavian immigrants were seen in more and more positive light, and eventually the two cultures would intermingle. Norse women married into Narish families, 

By the end of the 10th century, they had been completely assimilated into Narish culture.

\chapter{Names}

Narish names are of widespread origins, stemming from native Narish traditional naming conventions, names of Scandinavian and British immigrants, as well as combinations thereof.
